# qrcode_project
Fun little experimental python project which creates a QR Code image that can be used to hold many things, for example this qr code holds a profile image taking me to my github repo! this was also done by following a fantastic guide called  "How to Generate and Decode QR Codes in Python A starter guide in handling QR codes in your Python app".
